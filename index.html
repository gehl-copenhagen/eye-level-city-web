<h1>Gehl - Eye Level City app</h1>

<p>
  The Eye Level City app is a research tool based on the Urban Belonging app and adapted for Gehl. The Urban Belonging app was developed as part of the project ‘Urban Belonging’ that studied how members of different organizations in Copenhagen (e.g. minorities, handicapped and LGBTQ+) felt a sense of belonging to the city. The project was a collaboration between researchers from Aalborg University, GEHL architects, IT University of Copenhagen and Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

  The app enables the user to take photos of urban phenomena and indicate both the sentiment and the content of the picture taken. Furthermore, the user is allowed to react with similar annotations to the photos of other participants in the research project. This makes it possible to study how groups of users perceive the city in different ways.
</p>

<p>
  The project is built upon the app 'Snappthis' by Marije ten Brink and its redevelopment was funded by Ander Koed Madsen's project 'Doing Data Together', developed by Iain Kettles and designed by Marcos Cisneros. The original app is open-source and more information can be found at the <a href="https://urbanbelonging.com/">Urban Belonging Website</a>. The Gehl-adaption is made by Gehl’s in-house developers.
